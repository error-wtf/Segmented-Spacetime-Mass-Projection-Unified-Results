## 👥 How External Contributors Work

### For Everyone Else (Not Owners):

**You CANNOT push directly to this repository.**

**Correct Workflow:**

1. **Fork the Repository**
   ```bash
   # On GitHub: Click "Fork" button
   # This creates YOUR copy: your-username/Segmented-Spacetime-Mass-Projection-Unified-Results
   ```

2. **Clone YOUR Fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Segmented-Spacetime-Mass-Projection-Unified-Results
   cd Segmented-Spacetime-Mass-Projection-Unified-Results
   ```

3. **Make Changes in Your Fork**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # Make your changes
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your changes"
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name  # This pushes to YOUR fork only!
   ```

4. **Create Pull Request**
   - Go to GitHub
   - Navigate to your fork
   - Click "Pull Request"
   - Request merge into `error-wtf/Segmented-Spacetime-Mass-Projection-Unified-Results:main`
   - Wait for owner review

5. **Owners Review & Merge**
   - Carmen/Lino review your PR
   - If approved: They merge into main
   - If changes needed: You update your fork
   - **You never push to main directly**

## 📚 Documentation Commands Explained

### Why Git Push Commands Are in Documentation

**You may see commands like:**
```bash
git push origin main
```

**These are for:**
- ✅ Repository owners (Carmen, Lino)
- ✅ Documentation of maintainer workflow
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline reference

**These are NOT for:**
- ❌ External contributors
- ❌ General public
- ❌ Anyone without explicit permission

**If you try to push without permission:**
```
remote: Permission to error-wtf/Segmented-Spacetime-Mass-Projection-Unified-Results.git denied.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/error-wtf/...': The requested URL returned error: 403
```

**You will get HTTP 403 Forbidden error.**

## 🔐 Security Measures

### Repository Security

1. **Branch Protection (main) - MAXIMUM SECURITY**
   - ✅ Enabled and enforced
   - ✅ **Delete protection: ENABLED** (cannot delete main branch)
   - ✅ **Force push: BLOCKED** (cannot rewrite history)
   - ✅ Requires pull request reviews before merge
   - ✅ Requires status checks to pass (CI/CD)
   - ✅ Requires linear history (no merge commits without review)
   - ✅ Requires signed commits (optional but recommended)
   - ✅ Restrictions apply to administrators (even owners protected)
   - ✅ Cannot delete branches without explicit permission
   - ✅ Cannot bypass via any method (web UI, CLI, API)

2. **Deletion Protection - CRITICAL**
   - ✅ Main branch: **CANNOT be deleted** (protected)
   - ✅ Tags: Protected from deletion
   - ✅ Releases: Permanent once published
   - ✅ Commits: Cannot be removed (history immutable)
   - ✅ Files: Deletion requires commit + review (traceable)
   - ⚠️ **Any deletion attempt will fail with 403 error**

3. **Write Access - RESTRICTED**
   - ✅ Restricted to 2 owners only (Carmen, Lino)
   - ✅ No public write access
   - ✅ No collaborators with write access
   - ✅ Fork-based contribution model (external)
   - ✅ All changes via Pull Request (reviewed)

4. **Credentials & Secrets**
   - ✅ No credentials in repository
   - ✅ API keys in .env (not tracked, .gitignore)
   - ✅ Secrets in GitHub Secrets (for Actions)
   - ✅ Environment variables encrypted
   - ✅ No hardcoded passwords or tokens

5. **Automated Security Checks**
   - ✅ GitHub Actions run on all PRs
   - ✅ Tests must pass before merge (71 tests)
   - ✅ Code scanning enabled (vulnerabilities)
   - ✅ Dependency scanning (known CVEs)
   - ✅ Secret scanning (leaked credentials)
   - ✅ No malicious code patterns detected

6. **Audit Trail**
   - ✅ All changes logged in Git history
   - ✅ Commit author tracked
   - ✅ Pull Request reviews recorded
   - ✅ Merge history preserved
   - ✅ **Deletions traceable** (if any occur)

## 🔄 Contribution Workflow Summary

### Standard Workflow for External Contributors

```
1. YOU: Fork repository (creates YOUR copy)
2. YOU: Clone YOUR fork to local machine
3. YOU: Make changes in YOUR fork
4. YOU: Push to YOUR fork (you own it, allowed)
5. YOU: Create Pull Request to main repository
6. OWNERS: Review your PR
7. OWNERS: Merge if approved (or request changes)
8. YOU: Sync your fork with updated main
```

**At NO point do you push to main repository.**

**You always work in your fork.**

## 📊 Access Statistics

**Repository Access (Public):**
- Reads: Unlimited (public repository)
- Clones: Unlimited (anyone can clone)
- Forks: Unlimited (anyone can fork)
- Writes: 2 people only (Carmen, Lino)

**Current Collaborators with Write Access:**
- Total: 2 (owners only)
- External Collaborators: 0
- Public Contributors: Via PRs only

---

## ✅ Summary

**IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND:**

1. ✅ This is a **public repository** (anyone can read/clone/fork)
2. ✅ Only **2 people** can push directly (Carmen, Lino)
3. ✅ Everyone else contributes via **Fork + Pull Request**
4. ✅ `git push` commands in docs are **for owners only**
5. ✅ You **will get 403 error** if you try to push without permission
6. ✅ This is **normal and correct** - it's how GitHub security works
7. ✅ Follow **CONTRIBUTING.md** for how to contribute
8. ⚠️ **DELETION IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED** - Main branch protected, history immutable
9. ⚠️ **FORCE PUSH IS BLOCKED** - Cannot rewrite published history
10. ✅ All security enforced by **GitHub, not just documentation**

**Nobody can push "ungefragt" (without permission) - GitHub prevents it automatically.**

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Nobody can delete branches, files, or commits "ungefragt" - Branch protection and GitHub permissions block ALL destructive operations automatically.**

## 🛡️ DELETION PROTECTION - MOST IMPORTANT

### Why Deletion is Strictly Forbidden

**The main concern: Preventing unauthorized deletion of code, branches, or history.**

### What is Protected:

1. **Main Branch - CANNOT be deleted**
   - Protected by GitHub branch protection rules
   - Even repository owners cannot delete it accidentally
   - Requires explicit disabling of protection (logged action)
   - Any deletion attempt: 403 Forbidden

2. **All Commits - PERMANENT**
   - Once pushed, commits are immutable
   - Cannot be deleted without force push
   - Force push is BLOCKED on main branch
   - Git history is permanent record

3. **All Files - TRACEABLE**
   - File deletion requires commit
   - Commit must pass review (for main)
   - Deletion is visible in history
   - Can be reverted at any time

4. **Tags & Releases - PROTECTED**
   - Release tags cannot be deleted
   - Published releases permanent
   - Version history preserved

### How Protection Works:

```
User attempts: git push --delete origin main
GitHub responds: ERROR 403 Forbidden

User attempts: git push --force origin main
GitHub responds: ERROR 403 Forbidden (Branch protection)

User attempts: Delete branch via Web UI
GitHub responds: Protected branch cannot be deleted

User attempts: Delete file without commit
GitHub responds: Must commit changes (traceable)
```

### Multiple Layers of Protection:

1. **GitHub Permissions** - Only 2 people have write access
2. **Branch Protection** - Main branch locked against deletion
3. **Force Push Block** - Cannot rewrite history
4. **Audit Trail** - All actions logged
5. **Review Required** - Changes must be reviewed
6. **CI/CD Checks** - Tests must pass

### Summary:

**🔒 DELETION IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR UNAUTHORIZED USERS**
- No write access = No deletion ability
- Branch protection = Main cannot be deleted
- Force push blocked = History cannot be rewritten
- All changes tracked = Deletions are visible

**Even if someone had write access (they don't), they still couldn't delete the main branch due to branch protection.**

**Even owners rarely delete anything - destructive operations are avoided as policy.**
